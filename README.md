# Node.js Backend with TypeScript 🚀

A backend project built with **Node.js** and **TypeScript** to learn and apply modern backend development practices such as type safety, structured code, and scalable architecture.

This repository is part of my learning journey where I focus on **writing real-world backend code**, not just tutorials.

---

## 🧠 Purpose of This Project

- Learn how to use **TypeScript with Node.js**
- Understand backend folder structure and tooling
- Practice building APIs with type safety
- Prepare for frameworks like **Express**, **NestJS**, and **React (TS)**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **ts-node**
- **nodemon**
- (Express will be added later)

## ▶️ Running the Project

### 🔥 Development Mode (recommended)

Runs TypeScript directly with auto-reload.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 🏗️ Build for Production

Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript.

```bash
npm run build
```

### 🚀 Start Production Server

```bash
npm start
```

## 📜 Available Scripts

| Command         | Description                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | Run server with ts-node & nodemon |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to JavaScript  |
| `npm start`     | Run compiled JS from `dist/`      |

## 🧩 TypeScript Configuration Highlights

* `strict: true` → Enables strong type safety
* `rootDir: src` → Keeps source code organized
* `outDir: dist` → Clean build output
* `esModuleInterop: true` → Smooth ES imports

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

* [x] TypeScript basics (types, unions, enums, classes)
* [x] Node.js + TypeScript setup
* [ ] Express with TypeScript
* [ ] REST API design
* [ ] Environment variables
* [ ] Authentication (JWT)
* [ ] Database integration
